# Analysis of Charging Infrastructure in Germany

To reduce CO₂ emissions, the European Union has enacted a law banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars starting in [2035](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20221019STO44572/eu-ban-on-sale-of-new-petrol-and-diesel-cars-from-2035-explained). This transition will significantly increase the demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and, consequently, for charging infrastructure.

## Question
The key question is: Is Germany prepared for this shift? Does the country have the necessary charging infrastructure to support the growing number of electric vehicles, or are there critical gaps that need to be addressed?
